🏎️ F1 Podium Probability Analysis — Professional Analytics Workflow
📌 Overview
This repository documents a full end‑to‑end analytics process designed to estimate the probability of a Formula 1 driver achieving a podium finish. The work follows a structured, professional approach commonly used in data analytics teams: business understanding, data preparation, exploratory analysis, modelling, and insight generation.
The analysis uses publicly available datasets from Kaggle, combining historical race results (1950–2020) with driver demographic and career information.

🎯 Business Context
Podium finishes are a critical performance indicator in Formula 1. They influence:
- Team championship points
- Driver market value
- Sponsorship exposure
- Strategic decision‑making on race weekends
Stakeholders such as race strategists, performance engineers, sponsors, and media analysts rely on data‑driven insights to understand the factors that drive podium outcomes.
This analysis aims to support those decisions by identifying the variables that most strongly predict podium success.

🧩 Objective
To develop an interpretable, data‑driven model that estimates the probability of a driver finishing on the podium for a given race, and to provide actionable insights based on historical trends.

🛠️ Professional Analytics Workflow
1. Business Understanding
- Define the problem: What factors influence podium finishes, and how predictable are they?
- Identify stakeholders and their needs
- Establish success criteria (accuracy, interpretability, actionable insights)
2. Data Understanding
- Review dataset structure and metadata
- Assess data quality, completeness, and limitations
- Identify key entities: drivers, constructors, circuits, races, results
3. Data Preparation
- Clean and standardize fields
- Resolve inconsistent driver/team identifiers
- Engineer features such as:
- Driver experience
- Constructor performance indicators
- Circuit characteristics
- Qualifying‑to‑race deltas
- Create an integrated analytical dataset
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend analysis (drivers, teams, circuits)
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution and variance checks
- Identification of key predictive variables
5. Modelling Approach
- Select an interpretable model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree)
- Train/test split
- Evaluate performance using:
- Accuracy
- Precision/recall
- ROC‑AUC
- Extract feature importance to support business insights
6. Insights & Recommendations
Translate analytical findings into stakeholder‑ready insights, such as:
- Impact of qualifying position on podium probability
- Team‑specific performance patterns
- Circuit‑level competitiveness
- Driver experience effects
7. Visualisation & Reporting
- Develop a dashboard (Power BI / Tableau) to present:
- Podium probability explorer
- Driver comparison tool
- Circuit insights
- Team performance trends
8. Conclusion & Next Steps
- Summarise key findings
- Highlight limitations
- Propose future enhancements (e.g., weather data, tyre strategy, safety car modelling)
